The script implements support for two (actually three) dataset- one was provided and one was selected from UCI repository (cryotherapy dataset)

In order to train and test the model just run the script as follows:

`python3 NeuralNet_cryo.py` 

By default it will run on Cryotherapy data. It will also print the test error in the end as shows in hw2_report.pdf.

You can also find data_exploration.ipynb where I explored the data using pandas and numpy.
